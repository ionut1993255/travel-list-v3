## Key Features

- **State Management with Redux Toolkit**: Utilizes `Redux Toolkit`, a powerful package built on top of `Redux`, for streamlined state management. This ensures predictable state updates across components while reducing boilerplate code.

- **Asynchronous Actions with Redux Thunk**: Integrates `Redux Thunk` middleware to handle asynchronous actions, such as fetching data or performing side effects. This enables smoother user interactions and enhances the overall user experience.

- **Persistent Data Storage**: Implements custom hooks, `useLocalStorageState` and `useLocalStorageTravelItemsState`, to securely store packing list items using the `localStorage`. This ensures that users can access and modify their lists across sessions, providing a seamless experience.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Enhances the user experience with real-time notifications using `react-hot-toast`, providing instant feedback on successful actions and updates. Users stay informed about changes to their packing list in real-time, improving usability.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Built with `React`, the leading `JavaScript` library for building user interfaces, ensuring a responsive and interactive application.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Incorporates `Redux Toolkit` for state management, offering simplified configuration and enhanced developer experience. This helps in maintaining a scalable and efficient codebase.

- **Redux Thunk**: Utilizes `Redux Thunk` middleware to enable asynchronous actions and side effects within `Redux` workflows, enhancing application functionality. Asynchronous operations, such as data fetching, are seamlessly integrated into `Redux` workflows.

- **Custom Hooks**: Implements custom hooks for managing local storage and application-specific functionality, enhancing code reusability and maintainability. Custom hooks simplify complex logic and promote a modular architecture, improving code organization.
